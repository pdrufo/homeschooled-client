# HomeSchool'd

Our schools have closed for the rest of the year due to the
coronavirus pandemic. As a parent, we are thrust into a new role as
a teacher and have to balance work, school and life. This app will
help organize our kids/students daily required activities so we can
make sure they are meeting their school goals.
